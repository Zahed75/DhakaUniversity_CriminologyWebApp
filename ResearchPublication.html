								Mission:
							</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The department aims to study crime and criminal behavior from a scientific perspective,
							while also critically analyzing such events in the societal context of Bangladesh.
							Criminology in a developing country like Bangladesh requires the discipline to be empirical,
							data-driven, and policy relevant. The department of Criminology intends to provide its
							students with knowledge and tools that will ignite critical thinking and enable them to
							develop new crime theories, develop and modernize surveys on criminal victimization, analyze
							crime trends, understand the nature of implementation of some of the existing laws,
							application of the due process of law in law enforcement and the judiciary development and
							the methods and challenges of crime preventions. In accomplishing the goal, the department
							has introduced many contemporary courses to investigate crime cause and prevent criminal
							activities in Bangladesh.
						</dd>
						<dt>
							<a href="">Alumni Association: </a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							The Department of Criminology established Dhaka University Criminology Alumnae Association
							(DUCAA) in 2018, comprising of 39 committee members. Monirul Islam, the chief of Counter
							Terrorism Unit of Bangladesh has been elected as the president of DUCAA, alongside Supreme
							Courte attorney Nazneen Sultana Sukhee as the General Secretary, and the deputy commissioner
							of the Counter Terrorism Unit Abdul Mannan as the organizing secretory
						</dd>

							</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<b class="und"> Arranging Colloquium: </b>
							The Department of Criminology arranges monthly colloquium where public intellectuals and
							scholars in different fields lecture on contemporary issues. These colloquiums aim to
							provoke students’ intellectual capabilities, to think about the contemporary world and
							changes, to understand how people around the world as well as Bangladesh are coping and
							reacting with these changes and in this context how the nature of crime is changing and what
							would be the proper mechanism of preventing crime etc. For example, in March 2020, the
							Department of Criminology celebrated International Women’s Day and organized a workshop on
							“Violence against Women’ and documentary screening in collaboration with Bangadesh Mohila
							Samity. Very recently, the department hosts a virtual talk on Perspectives of Crime and

							Bangladesh Police were the speakers. <br><br>
							<b class="und">International Conference:</b> <br>
							<p>The department organized its first international conference on Terrorism in the Wave of
								Islamic States in 2017 and Rohingya: Politics, Ethnic Cleansing and Uncertainty in 2018.
								The department received a numerous number of papers on this topic from various
								participants from all over the world. The best papers were presented in various sessions
								during the conference.

								In considering the three landmark events of the country, i.e., the golden jubilee of
								independence of Bangladesh, centennial birth celebration of the Father of Nation
								Bangabandhu Seikh Mujibar Rahman and the Celebration of DU Centenary, the Department of
								Criminology, University of Dhaka in collaboration with Ryukoku University, Japan and
								National Forensic Sciences University, will organize an international conference on
								Criminology and Forensic Science in the Global South from 8 to 9 August 2021.

							<p>The Department of Criminology encourages the students to participate in different games
								and sports events (i.e., football, cricket, handball etc). Hence, the students regularly
								participate in “Inter Department Football Tournament” and “Inter Department Cricket
								Tournament”. In a similar fashion, the department encourages the cultural development of
								the students in the arena of literature, music, dance, debate etc. Simultaneously, as
								part of the commitment to protect environment, the Department organizes monthly
								Cleanliness Awareness Program to engage students in community works. </p>
